# MapEditor
MapEditor exercise @ &lt;Academia de C처digo_> to apply basic Java I/O mechanisms at week 5 of the #8 BootCamp in Fund찾o
Using SimpleGFX and applying the newly learned skills to read and write from file using a BufferedReader and Writer.

Use arrows to navigate the cells.
Space key will color a cell or uncolor.
S key will save current drawing.
R key will clear current drawing.
L key will load previously saved drawing.
C key will change color.

Have fun! I sure had fun cracking another challenge @ <Academia de C처digo_> in Fund찾o.
